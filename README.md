## Matt Jordan's Google Homepage Clone

This is my Google homepage clone for the first assignment of The Odin Project.

Most of the links will function and the search bar will actually work as it would on the real Google homepage.

In this project I learned and practiced:

  1. How to write webpage content in HTML.
  2. How to create responsive styling of HTML content using CSS.
  3. Use of CSS classes, IDs, pseudo-classes, combinators, and more.
  3. How to use HTML forms (my search bar actually redirects to the Google search for the input!).
  4. How to style elements using flexbox.
  5. CSS styling hierarchy and how it relates to the HTML.

Please enjoy and any constructive feedback is welcome!
